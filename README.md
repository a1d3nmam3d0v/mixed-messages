# Mixed Messages

A Codecademy portfolio project that generates random Britney Spears moments by combining different looks, locations, and actions.

## Project Overview

This project is part of the Codecademy Full-Stack Engineer Career Path. It demonstrates JavaScript fundamentals by creating a program that outputs random messages every time it runs.

## About

This message generator creates random iconic Britney Spears moments by combining:
- **Looks**: Various iconic outfits and appearances
- **Locations**: Different memorable settings
- **Actions**: Famous Britney moments and activities

Each time you run the program, you'll get a unique combination that describes a random Britney moment!

## Codecademy Project Requirements

To complete this project, the program must:
1. Build a message generator program using JavaScript
2. Use Git version control to track changes
3. Store the program on GitHub for portfolio purposes
4. Generate random messages that combine at least 3 different pieces of data
5. Output the random message to the console
6. Use at least 3 different arrays to store data
7. Implement at least 1 function that generates the random message

## Features

- Generates random combinations of Britney Spears looks, locations, and actions
- Special "Work, bitch!" message when all three random indices match (rare easter egg!)
- Easy to extend with more looks, locations, and actions

## Technologies Used

- JavaScript (Node.js)
- Git/GitHub for version control

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed on your computer
2. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/a1d3nmam3d0v/mixed-messages.git
   ```
3. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd mixed-messages
   ```
4. Run the script:
   ```bash
   node script.js
   ```

## Example Output

```
A sparkly ringmaster jacket and top hat in the center of a three-ring circus cracking the whip like a master.

Not quite a match but still iconic.
```

## Future Improvements

- Add more iconic Britney looks, locations, and actions
- Create a web interface to display the generated messages
- Add images to accompany each generated moment
- Allow users to share their favorite generated moments
